# Etudes
A collection of my individual Etudes I completed throughout a course. Etudes are a collection of problems aimed to test your computational problem-solving.

Dates: Dates is a program which reads dates inputted by a user and validates whether or not a date is valid between the years 1753 and 3000 (inclusive).

Koch Snowflake: The purpose of this program is to display an interactive Koch Snowflake based on a given order by the user.

Where In The World: The objective of this task is to create a program that can convert a sequence of coordinates (in Standard, DMS, DM format) into a GeoJSON file and visually display the resulting file for the user.

Bug Squashing: Acting as a senior developer, you must reply to a junior developer who has given you incorrect and poorly written C code on how they fix it.
